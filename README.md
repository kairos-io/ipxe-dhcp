This repository is used to build a generic ipxe iso image that boot from dhcp.

For example, when a [pixiecore instance](https://github.com/danderson/netboot/tree/master/pixiecore) is running on the same network, this iso
will get the boot files from it.

This iso is built using the ipxe script from the pixiecore project:
